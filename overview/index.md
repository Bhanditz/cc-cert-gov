## Why Needed?

Governments around the world are increasingly using open licensing to expand the impact and reach of their work, enable innovative use of federally funded materials, and ensure that publicly funded resources are available to the public that paid for them.

Government grant programs for research, education, science, and data often include requirements for open licensing. Creative Commons licenses are the primary means by which those requirements are fulfilled. A thorough understanding of Creative Commons is needed by government staff in order to:
* Make and support policy decisions based on open licensing
* Write procurement language and requirements
* Understand implications of CC license types and proper application
* Support grantees in fulfilling requirements
* Monitor and evaluate results

## Who is this for?

The Creative Commons Government Certificate is designed to help government agencies and departments skill up internal leaders, policy makers, decision makers, and support staff on the value, use, and implementation of Creative Commons licenses for their programs. Certificate learning activities are targeted, pragmatic, and applied. The aim is to ensure all staff have the knowledge and skills they need to successfully perform Creative Commons related responsibilities.

## What you skills and knowledge will you gain?

On completion of the certificate government staff will be able to:

* explain the benefits of Creative Commons licenses
* understand the relationship of Creative Commons to copyright and the commons
* demonstrate the ability to put a Creative Commons license on works
* descibe how to find, reuse, revise and curate openly licensed works
* recommend policies and grant procurement language associated with use of open licenses
* provide Creative Commons related training and support services
* help plan governmental systematic changes towards openness
