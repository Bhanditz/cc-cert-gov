# Copyright Module Summit Quest

Now that you have completed the units in this module, the Summit Quest is your opportunity to demonstrate your applied understanding of the copyright.

As a review this summit quest will draw upon your knowledge of these units:

* [Copyright Basics](basics.md) Is copyright a bit fuzzy to you? Get some clarity by understanding it's history and purpose.
* [Copyright vs Other Intellectual Property](other-ip.md) How does copyright differ from intellectual property (IP) rights of trademark, patents,and trade secrets?
* [Scope of Public Domain](public-domain.md) Copyright protection is not forever, at some point the protection expires and works enter the public domain. 
* [Exceptions and Limitations of Copyright](exceptions-limitations.md) Known in some parts of the world as "fair use" or "fair dealing",  limitations and exceptions built into copyright were designed to allow exceptions for certain kinds of uses such as criticism, parody, scholarship, and research.
* [Global Aspects of Copyright](global.md) Copyright laws are defined by countries yet we operate in a world where media is global in reach. Complexity ensues.

If you choose to use a pre-4.0 version or any ported version, clauses such as choice of law may affect your desired choice of license. You can also read CC case studies to learn about some of the inspiring ways CC licenses and tools have been used to share works and support innovative business models. If that is not the case and someone has marked your work with a CC license without your authorization, you should contact that person and tell them to remove the license from your work. To CC's knowledge, the licenses have never been held unenforceable or invalid. Note that this does not require you to ShareAlike any copyright or other rights you have in the individual contents of the database.

As explained above, the current version of the CC license suite (4.0) licenses sui generis database rights in addition to copyright and other closely related rights. For example, you may incorporate a CC BY photograph into a Wikipedia article so long as you keep all copyright notices intact, provide proper attribution, and otherwise comply with the terms of CC BY. 'Licensor', 'rights holder', 'owner', and 'creator' may be used interchangeably to refer to the person or entity applying a CC license. You should also understand that licensors do not offer warranties or guarantees about the material they are licensing unless expressly indicated otherwise.
