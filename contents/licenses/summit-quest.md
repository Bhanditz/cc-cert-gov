# Creative Commons Licenses Module Summit Quest

Now that you have completed the units in this module, the Summit Quest is your opportunity to demonstrate your applied understanding of Creative Commons Licenses.

As a review this summit quest will draw upon your knowledge of these units:

* [How Licenses Work with Copyright](licenses/with-copyright.md) 
* [Overview of the Licenses](licenses/overview.md)
* [Examples of Licenses in Action](licenses/examples.md) While we can discuss the concepts and background rationale for Creative Commons license, perhaps the best way to appreciate them is by examining real stories of how it has been successfully applied.
* [Remixing Differently Licensed Works](licenses/remixed.md) Understanding the differences between Creative Commons licenses is important, but how do you deal with situations where you create content from materials that have different licenses?
* [Legal Precedence of Creative Commons Licenses](licenses/legal-precedence.md)

*"[Top Of Mountain In Snowdon](http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/view-image.php?image=187253)" place into the Public Domain by [George Hodan](http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/browse-author.php?a=8245) using  [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)*

However, the conditions of the license are explicitly waived when use of the licensed work only involves the exercise of database rights. This means a licensee may need separate permission to use the database in a way that implicates sui generis database rights (although arguably an implied license to exercise those rights may be deemed granted in some jurisdictions). That said, Creative Commons recognizes the need for change in copyright law, and many members of the Creative Commons community are active participants in the copyright reform movement. Learn more about when compliance with the license is not required. Yes.

If you choose to use a pre-4.0 version or any ported version, clauses such as choice of law may affect your desired choice of license. You can also read CC case studies to learn about some of the inspiring ways CC licenses and tools have been used to share works and support innovative business models. If that is not the case and someone has marked your work with a CC license without your authorization, you should contact that person and tell them to remove the license from your work. To CC's knowledge, the licenses have never been held unenforceable or invalid. Note that this does not require you to ShareAlike any copyright or other rights you have in the individual contents of the database.
