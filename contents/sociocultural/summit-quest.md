# Sociocultural Module Summit Quest

Now that you have completed the units in this module, the Summit Quest is your opportunity to demonstrate your applied understanding of sociocultural issues.

As a review this summit quest will draw upon your knowledge of these units:

* [How the Open Model is Better](open-better.md) How do you convince the people who you work with to openly share their work when their response is “Why would I give away what I made for free?”
* [Shifting to Open](shift-open.md)
* [Promoting Openness](promoting-open.md)
* [Community Development for Openness](community-development.md)

*"[Top Of Mountain In Snowdon](http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/view-image.php?image=187253)" place into the Public Domain by [George Hodan](http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/browse-author.php?a=8245) using  [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)*

CC also does not require registration of the work with a national copyright agency. BY = Attribution only. They depend on the tools and services CC provides through their reuse and remix of the rich, open resources available on Wikipedia, Flickr, SoundCloud, Vimeo, ‎Europeana, MIT OpenCourseWare, the Library of Science, Al Jazeera, and YouTube—just to name a few. 

For example, U.S. government works are automatically in the public domain under U.S. copyright law, but might be restricted by copyright in other countries. For example, Brazil's copyright code protects all works of the mind that do not fall within the list of works that are expressly defined in the statue as 'unprotected works.' Consult your jurisdiction's copyright law for more information.

However unlike copyright, database rights protect the maker's investment, not originality. May I use the Creative Commons logo and buttons? This feature (and others) distinguish CC licenses from some other open licenses like the ODbL and ODC-BY, both of which are intended to impose contractual conditions and restrictions on the reuse of databases in jurisdictions where there is no underlying copyright or sui generis database right. Creators and other rights holders may wish to check with their collecting society before applying a CC license to their material. While many if not most CC-licensed works are available at no cost, some licensors charge for initial access to CC-licensed works—for example, by publishing CC-licensed content only to subscribers, or by charging for downloads.
